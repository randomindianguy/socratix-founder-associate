- **How Socratix Wins** — competitive attribute matrix scoring 4 approaches (manual teams, rule engines, ML platforms, AI agents) across 6 buyer-evaluated dimensions. Includes counter-positioning analysis.
- **What It's Worth** — interactive ROI calculator. Plug in team size, salary, alert volume, false positive rate, and investigation time. Outputs annual savings, hours freed, and headcount equivalence.
- **What I'd Ship** — 30-day plan scoped for a founding team, plus author card.
